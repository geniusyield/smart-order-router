Description : These are the queries _we think_ most order matching strategies will
make in order to perform the order matching task. New queries can be added of course,
but whether or not new queries will be efficient depends entirely on the implementation
under the hood.

For now, the most common "order matching queries" are exported in this module, as
well utilities to construct the order book.

that can efficiently answer queries like:
1. What are the intersecting buy and sell orders?
2. What is the max bid?
3. What is the min ask?

etc.

     interesting on your implementation, you can always give the instance with
     the empty object.

{- | Given a DB connection to a database holding information about GY DEX orders on the blockchain,
return a populated OrderBook.

Also takes the compiled plutus scripts of the GY DEX.

Also takes a list of token pairs to filter uninteresting orders. This should be
passed to the datasource function(s).

The 'OrderBot.DataSource' signature also exposes functions to query buy orders, and sell orders.
This implementation may use those as necessary.

{- | Left associative fold over the 'Orders' data structure.

The order in which each 'OrderInfo' is passed onto the function, depends on the type of

For sell orders, it should act like a 'foldr' on a list with _ascending_ orders based on price.
For buy orders, it should act like a 'foldr' on a list with _descending_ orders based on price.
